Teachers demonstrate strong subject knowledge and use effective pedagogical approaches. We have invested in validated schemes (e.g., Little Wandle for phonics, White Rose for mathematics) and ensure these are implemented with fidelity.

Pupil outcomes demonstrate that the majority of pupils, including disadvantaged pupils and those with SEND, are achieving well.

Pupils demonstrate positive attitudes to learning.
