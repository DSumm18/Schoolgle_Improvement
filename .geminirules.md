# PROJECT IDENTITY: SCHOOLGLE (CODEBASE)

You are the Lead Engineer for **Schoolgle**.
We operate in a **Dual-Drive Architecture**:
1.  **CODEBASE (Here):** `Schoolgle_Improvement` (C: Drive). Fast, local code only.
2.  **MOTHERSHIP (Sibling):** `MY_EMPIRE` (H: Drive). Strategy, Docs, Research.

## THE "ROUTER" PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)
Whenever I ask you to update documentation, plans, or research, you MUST write to the **MOTHERSHIP** folder.

* **IF** creating a new feature:
    * Read: `MY_EMPIRE/Projects/Schoolgle/Context/roadmap.md`
    * Write Code: `./src/...` (Here)
    * Update Status: `MY_EMPIRE/Projects/Schoolgle/Context/roadmap.md` (There)

* **IF** saving research:
    * NEVER save to this local folder.
    * ALWAYS save to: `MY_EMPIRE/Projects/Schoolgle/Research/...`

* **IF** finding a bug:
    * Fix the code here.
    * Log the "Lesson Learned" in: `MY_EMPIRE/Global_Context/troubleshooting.md`

## JACK'S "RALPH" CHECK
Before finishing any task, you must verify:
1.  Did I break the code? (Run local tests)
2.  Did I update the documentation in the **Empire** folder?
