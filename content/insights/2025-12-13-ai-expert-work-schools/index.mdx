Recent AI updates are quietly shifting expert work. What this means for schools — and why people still matter.

## The Shift Nobody's Talking About

For years, automation meant replacing repetitive work. AI is different. The latest models aren't just automating tasks—they're beginning to replicate expert judgment in ways that matter for schools.

When AI can draft inspection reports, analyze safeguarding concerns, or suggest curriculum changes, we're not talking about replacing filing clerks. We're talking about work that requires professional judgment, context, and accountability.

## What This Means for Schools

School leaders face a unique challenge: AI tools promise efficiency, but education decisions carry real consequences. A poorly timed curriculum change affects hundreds of students. A missed safeguarding signal can have serious outcomes. An inspection report shapes a school's future.

The question isn't whether AI will change how schools operate—it's whether schools will shape how AI is used, or simply react to it.

## Why people still matter

AI can act logically but miss human context. In schools, AI must support professional judgement, not replace it. Final decisions always sit with trained staff who understand the full picture—the child's history, the school's culture, the community's needs.

Technology amplifies capability, but it doesn't replace responsibility. School leaders, teachers, and support staff bring something AI cannot: the ability to weigh competing priorities, read subtle signals, and make decisions that account for what can't be measured.

## GDPR and Trust

Schoolgle does not replace human decision-making. AI outputs are advisory. Data protection and professional accountability remain central to everything we build.

When schools use AI tools, they need clarity on three things: who makes the final decision, how data is protected, and where accountability sits. At Schoolgle, we're clear: AI supports your judgment. You make the calls. You own the outcomes.
