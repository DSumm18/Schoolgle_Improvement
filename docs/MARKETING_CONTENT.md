# Schoolgle Marketing Content

## 1. Home Page

### Hero Headline (Primary)
**Take the fear out of Ofsted inspections**

### Hero Headline Alternatives
- **Stay inspection-ready without the panic**
- **Inspection readiness that works in the background**

### Subheading
Schoolgle helps UK primary schools prepare for Ofsted and SIAMS inspections by organising evidence, tracking actions, and generating reports automatically. No spreadsheets. No last-minute panic.

### Key Value Pillars (3)

**1. Evidence organised automatically**
Your policies, assessments, and improvement plans are mapped to inspection frameworks from day one. When inspection arrives, everything is already in place.

**2. Actions tracked without the admin**
See what needs doing, who's responsible, and what's overdue. Schoolgle keeps your improvement plan visible and actionable without adding to anyone's workload.

**3. Reports generated in minutes**
One-click SEF generation, action plan summaries, and evidence mapping reports. What used to take days now takes minutes.

### How It Works (High-Level, 3 Steps)

**Step 1: Connect your existing systems**
Link your Google Drive, Microsoft 365, or other document storage. Schoolgle reads what you already have—no manual uploads required.

**Step 2: Evidence is mapped automatically**
Documents are scanned and matched to Ofsted and SIAMS framework requirements. You see gaps immediately, not when inspection arrives.

**Step 3: Reports and actions stay current**
Your self-evaluation form updates as evidence changes. Action plans track progress automatically. Everything stays inspection-ready.

### Primary CTA Text
**Join the Early Access Pilot**

### Trust-Building Section
Built with UK primary schools, for UK primary schools. Schoolgle is designed by school leaders who understand the pressure of inspection readiness. We're working with a small group of pilot schools to ensure the platform works in real school environments, not just in theory.

## 2. How It Works

### Step-by-Step Narrative

**Getting started takes less than 10 minutes**

When you first log in, Schoolgle scans your connected document storage. It identifies policies, assessment data, improvement plans, and other evidence. Within minutes, you'll see a dashboard showing which areas of the Ofsted framework are well-evidenced and which need attention.

**What schools get in the first 10 minutes**

- A complete evidence map showing coverage across all inspection areas
- Automatic identification of policies, assessments, and action plans
- A gap analysis highlighting areas that need more evidence
- Your first draft self-evaluation form, ready to review and refine

**What improves over time**

As you continue using Schoolgle, the platform learns your school's structure and priorities. Evidence mapping becomes more accurate. Action plans stay automatically updated as tasks are completed. Reports become more tailored to your school's context. The longer you use it, the less manual work is required.

**The ongoing process**

Schoolgle runs quietly in the background. When new documents are added to your connected storage, they're automatically scanned and mapped. When action plan items are completed, reports update themselves. When inspection frameworks change, Schoolgle adapts. You focus on running your school; Schoolgle handles the inspection readiness admin.

## 3. Why Schoolgle

### Comparison vs Current Reality

**The current reality: spreadsheets, folders, and panic**

Most schools prepare for inspections using a combination of spreadsheets, shared folders, and memory. Evidence lives in different places. Tracking what's been done and what's outstanding requires manual cross-referencing. When inspection arrives, staff spend days—sometimes weeks—pulling together evidence that should already be organised.

**What Schoolgle changes**

Schoolgle replaces the spreadsheet-and-folder approach with a single platform that automatically organises evidence, tracks actions, and generates reports. Evidence is mapped to inspection frameworks from the moment it's created. Action plans are visible and trackable without manual updates. Reports generate themselves. Inspection readiness becomes a background process, not a crisis.

### Why This Is Different to Consultants

Consultants provide valuable expertise, but they're expensive and temporary. They come in, help you prepare, and leave. When the next inspection cycle begins, you're back to square one.

Schoolgle gives you the structure and tools consultants would set up, but it stays with your school permanently. It's a fraction of the cost of consultant support, and it improves over time as it learns your school's context. You get the benefits of expert-led inspection preparation without the ongoing consultancy fees.

### Why This Aligns with Ofsted Expectations

Ofsted expects schools to have a clear understanding of their strengths and areas for improvement. They want to see evidence of continuous improvement, not last-minute preparation. Schoolgle supports this by making self-evaluation an ongoing process, not an annual scramble.

The platform helps schools demonstrate the "quality of education" through organised evidence of curriculum intent, implementation, and impact. It supports "behaviour and attitudes" through clear tracking of policies and their implementation. It aids "personal development" and "leadership and management" through transparent action planning and progress tracking.

Schoolgle doesn't replace good leadership or teaching. It removes the administrative burden that prevents school leaders from focusing on what matters most.

## 4. Early Access / Pilot Page

### Who the Pilot Is For

The early access pilot is designed for UK primary schools, trusts, and MATs who want to shape Schoolgle's development. We're looking for Headteachers and School Business Managers who understand the challenges of inspection readiness and are willing to provide honest feedback.

### What Schools Get

Pilot schools receive full access to Schoolgle Improvement at no cost during the pilot period. This includes:

- Complete Ofsted and SIAMS framework coverage
- Automatic evidence mapping and gap analysis
- Self-evaluation form generation
- Action planning and progress tracking
- One-click report generation
- Priority support and direct input into product development

### What Feedback We Ask For

We ask pilot schools to use Schoolgle in their normal inspection preparation work and share feedback on:

- What works well and what doesn't
- Features that would make the biggest difference
- How the platform fits (or doesn't fit) into existing workflows
- What's missing that would make inspection readiness easier

Feedback can be as simple as a quick message or as detailed as a structured review. We're building this with schools, not for them, so your input directly shapes what Schoolgle becomes.

### Clear Reassurance

**No risk, no commitment**

The pilot is completely free. There's no payment required, no long-term commitment, and no obligation to continue after the pilot period. If Schoolgle isn't right for your school, you can stop using it at any time with no questions asked.

Your data remains yours. You can export everything at any time. We don't lock schools into the platform—we want you to use it because it helps, not because you're stuck with it.

**What happens after the pilot**

When the pilot ends, pilot schools will have the option to continue using Schoolgle at a discounted rate. There's no automatic conversion or hidden charges. You decide if and when you want to become a paying customer.

## Additional Content Notes

### Tone Guidelines
- Calm and credible, never salesy
- Confident but not hype-driven
- Use UK education terminology (Headteacher, School Business Manager, Ofsted, SIAMS, SEF)
- Avoid AI buzzwords—focus on outcomes, not technology
- Speak directly to the pain points school leaders face

### Key Messages to Reinforce
- Inspection readiness without panic
- Works with existing systems, doesn't replace them
- Built by school leaders, for school leaders
- Reduces admin, doesn't add to it
- Evidence organised from day one, not when inspection arrives
