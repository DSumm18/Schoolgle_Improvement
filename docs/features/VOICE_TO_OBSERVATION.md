# Voice-to-Observation

## Speak It. We Structure It.

### The Problem

Lesson observations are essential for school improvement, but:
- **30+ minutes** to write up each observation
- Notes get lost or become illegible
- Feedback delayed (sometimes days)
- Inconsistent format across observers
- No connection to research evidence
- Write-ups pile up, reducing observation frequency

**Result:** Leaders do fewer observations because the admin burden is too high.

### The Solution

Record your observations verbally. Let AI do the structuring.
