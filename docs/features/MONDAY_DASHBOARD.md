# Monday Dashboard

## Your School Improvement Command Centre

### The Problem

Every Monday morning, school leaders face the same challenge:
- 50+ unread emails
- Multiple meetings scheduled
- No clear picture of school improvement priorities
- Hours lost finding the information they need

**Time wasted weekly:** 3-5 hours just getting oriented

### The Solution

The Monday Dashboard gives you everything you need in **10 seconds flat**.
