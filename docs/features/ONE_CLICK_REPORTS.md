# One-Click Reports

## Generate Inspection-Ready Documents in Seconds

### The Problem

Schools spend **weeks** every year writing the same statutory documents:
- SEF takes 3-4 weeks to write
- Pupil Premium Strategy needs annual updates
- Sports Premium Report required by DfE
- SDP reviewed and rewritten annually

**Result:** 
- Stale documents (SEF "last updated 8 months ago")
- Copy-paste from previous years
- Inconsistent messaging
- Time stolen from actual improvement work

### The Solution

One click. 45 seconds. Done.

### Available Reports

| Report | Time | What It Includes |
|--------|------|------------------|
| **Self-Evaluation Form (SEF)** | 45s | Full SEF aligned to Ofsted 2025 |
| **Headteacher Report to Governors** | 60s | Performance summary, priorities |
| **Pupil Premium Strategy** | 30s | DfE-compliant format |
| **PE & Sport Premium Report** | 30s | 5 key indicators, swimming data |
| **School Development Plan** | 60s | Priorities, milestones, costs |
| **Safeguarding Annual Report** | 30s | Governor summary |
| **Quality of Education Summary** | 45s | Deep dive document |
