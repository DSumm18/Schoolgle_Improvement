# Mock Inspector

## Practice Makes Perfect. AI Makes It Possible.

### The Problem

When Ofsted call, even the best school leaders feel nervous. Why?
- **Unprepared for questions** - Inspectors probe deeply
- **Brain freeze** - Pressure makes people forget what they know
- **No practice available** - External mock inspections cost £500-2000/day
- **Can't practice at will** - Consultants have limited availability
- **Generic preparation** - Not tailored to YOUR school's weak areas

**Result:** Leaders underperform despite knowing their school well.

### The Solution

An AI inspector available 24/7, personalised to your school.

### How It Works

**Step 1: Select Your Persona**
Choose which inspector you want to practice with.

**Step 2: Start Simulation**
The AI generates questions based on YOUR school's self-assessment data.

**Step 3: See the Questions**
Each question includes:
- The main question
- Why inspectors ask this (context)
- Likely follow-up questions
- Expected evidence
- Red flags to avoid

**Step 4: Practice Conversation**
Type your answers and receive realistic follow-up probes.

### Example Questions

**Lead Inspector:**
> "What's your vision for education at this school, and how do you ensure all staff share it?"

*Follow-ups:*
- How do you communicate this vision to new staff?
- Can you give an example of how this vision influenced a recent decision?

*Expected Evidence:*
- Vision statement
- Staff meeting minutes
- CPD plan

*Red Flags:*
- Vague responses
- Disconnect between stated vision and practice

---

**Safeguarding Lead:**
> "Tell me about your safeguarding culture. How do staff know what to do if they have a concern?"

*Follow-ups:*
- What training have staff received recently?
- Can you walk me through a recent case (anonymised)?

*Expected Evidence:*
- Single Central Record
- Training records
- Concern logs
- Policy document

*Red Flags:*
- Hesitation
- Gaps in training
- Poor record keeping
