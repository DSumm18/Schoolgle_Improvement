## 🎨 Design Considerations

### Color Palette Alignment
**Current:** Gray monochrome (clean, professional)
**Assets:** Some bright colors in planet SVG

**Recommendation:**
- Keep current gray palette for main UI
- Planet animation could be used sparingly (loading screens, special pages)
- Or create monochrome version of planet animation

### Animation Strategy
**Current:** Origami particles forming words
**Assets:** Orbit/planet animation concept

**Options:**
1. Keep origami (unique, professional)
2. Switch to orbit animation (more dynamic)
3. Use both (origami for background, orbit for logo)

**Recommendation:** Keep origami, add orbit as optional enhancement
