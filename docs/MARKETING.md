## 🎯 Elevator Pitch

## 📊 The Problem We Solve

### The Reality for School Leaders Today

- **120+ hours** spent annually on inspection preparation
- **Scattered evidence** across Google Drive, OneDrive, filing cabinets
- **Outdated frameworks** - the Ofsted EIF changed November 2025
- **Reactive, not proactive** - scrambling when the call comes
- **No single source of truth** - different staff have different information
- **Expensive consultants** - £500-2000/day for external reviews

### The Cost of Getting It Wrong

- Poor inspection outcomes affect recruitment, funding, and reputation
- Staff burnout from administrative burden
- Missed deadlines on statutory documents
- Evidence gaps discovered too late
- Inconsistent self-evaluation across the school

## ✨ Feature Deep Dives

---

### 2. Ofsted Framework Tracker 📋

**What it is:** A complete mapping of the NEW November 2025 Ofsted Education Inspection Framework with self-assessment, evidence linking, and action planning.

**The Problem:** The framework changed significantly in November 2025. Schools are using outdated materials and missing key evaluation areas.

**Our Solution:**
- **6 evaluation areas** mapped to the NEW framework:
  - Inclusion (NEW focus area)
  - Curriculum & Teaching
  - Achievement
  - Attendance & Behaviour
  - Personal Development
  - Leadership & Governance

- 5-point scale replacing 4-point

- Safeguarding assessed separately

---

### 3. SIAMS Framework (Church Schools) ⛪

**What it is:** Full SIAMS Evaluation Schedule 2023 with the same powerful features as Ofsted tracking.

**The Problem:** Church schools need to prepare for TWO inspections but most tools only cover Ofsted.

**Our Solution:**
- **7 SIAMS strands** fully mapped
- **Inspection questions** with evidence requirements
- **Shared actions** that count for both frameworks
- **Christian distinctiveness** guidance built in

**The Benefit:**

### 4. Voice-to-Observation 🎤

**What it is:** Record lesson observations verbally and let AI structure them into professional feedback with EEF recommendations.

**The Problem:** Lesson observations take 30+ minutes to write up. Notes get lost. Feedback is delayed.

**Our Solution:**
1. **Record** your observations while walking around
2. **Transcribe** automatically using Whisper AI
3. **Process** into structured feedback:
   - Summary
   - Strengths (3-5 specific points)

- Automatic EEF research linking

---

### 5. One-Click Reports 📄

**What it is:** Generate inspection-ready statutory documents in seconds using your school's data.

- ✅ Pupil Premium Strategy Statement
- ✅ PE & Sport Premium Report

- Always aligned to current requirements
- DfE-compliant formats

---

### 6. Mock Inspector 🔍

**What it is:** Practice for inspection with AI personas that ask the questions real inspectors ask.

**The Problem:** Leaders freeze when inspectors ask probing questions. Practice is expensive (£500+/day for consultants).

**Our Solution:**
- **5 Inspector Personas:**
  - Lead Inspector (overall effectiveness)
  - Curriculum Deep Diver
  - Safeguarding Lead
  - SEND Specialist
  - EYFS Expert
- **Realistic questions** based on your school's data

**Key Stats:**
- Unlimited practice sessions
- Personalised to your weak areas
- Costs less than 1 hour of consultant time

---

### 7. Ed - Your AI Education Coach 🤖

**What it is:** A chatbot trained on the Ofsted framework, EEF Toolkit, and educational best practice.

**The Problem:** Leaders have questions at 9pm on Sunday. Google gives generic answers. EEF research is hard to navigate.

**Our Solution:**
Ed knows:
- Ofsted EIF 2025 inside out
- SIAMS Evaluation Schedule
- EEF Toolkit (35 strategies with impact data)
- Statutory document requirements
- Best practice from outstanding schools

Ask Ed anything:
- "What evidence do I need for Curriculum Intent?"
