> The Ofsted framework changed again in November 2025. Are you still using last year's materials?
> 
> There's a new 5-point grading scale. A new focus on Inclusion. A completely new Report Card format.
> 
> And let's be honest - when did you last update your SEF?"

**[VISUAL: Calendar showing "SEF Last Updated: 8 months ago" with red warning]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Here's what schools tell us:
> 
> - 120 hours a year on inspection prep
> - £2,000 on external consultants who visit once
> - Weekends lost to writing observations

> 
> It doesn't have to be this way."
