Headline: Clear and informative\r\n2. What's happening: Brief summary\r\n3. What you need to do: Action items\r\n4. Why it matters: Context\r\n5. Where to get help: Contact details\r\n\r\n### Crisis Communications\r\n**Principles:**\r\n1. Speed matters - acknowledge quickly\r\n2. Accuracy over speed - don't speculate\r\n3. Empathy first - show you care\r\n4. Transparency - what you know, what you don't know\r\n5. Single source of truth - one spokesperson\r\n6. Consistent messaging - all staff say the same thing\r\n\r\n**Process:**\r\n1. Gather facts (what do we know?)\r\n2. Identify stakeholders (who needs to know?)\r\n3. Draft key messages (what do we say?)\r\n4. Choose channels (how do we say it?)\r\n5. Monitor feedback (what are they saying?)\r\n6. Update regularly (keep them informed)\r\n\r\n### Media Relations\r\n**When media contacts you:**\r\n1. Get their deadline\r\n2. Ask what they're looking for\r\n3. Don't comment immediately - get time to check\r\n4. Refer to headteacher/trust CEO\r\n5. Keep a record of all contact\r\n\r\n**Never:**\r\n- Say \"no comment\" (sounds defensive)\r\n- Speak off the record (nothing is off the record)\r\n- Speculate about causes or blame\r\n- Discuss individual students or staff\r\n\r\n### Social Media for Schools\r\n**Best practices:**\r\n- Clear policy on who can post\r\n- Approval process for content\r\n- Regular monitoring\r\n- Respond to comments/queries promptly\r\n- Celebrate success (students, staff, events)\r\n- Remind parents of official channels for concerns\r\n\r\n**Red flags:**\r\n- Negative comments about individuals\r\n- Safeguarding concerns\r\n- Misinformation spreading\r\n- Crisis situations\r\n\r\n### Newsletters and Bulletins\r\n**Structure:**\r\n1. From the head/principal (personal touch)\r\n2. Key dates (upcoming events)\r\n3. Celebrations (student achievements)\r\n4. Information (policy changes, reminders)\r\n5. Contacts (who to talk to)\r\n\r\n**Frequency:**\r\n- Weekly or fortnightly works best\r\n- Consistent timing (e.g., every Friday)\r\n- Keep it concise (parents are busy)\r\n\r\n### Privacy and GDPR\r\n- Don't name students without permission\r\n- Don't use photos without consent\r\n- Be careful with staff information\r\n- Consider foster children, protected identities\r\n- Source: ICO Data Protection for Schools\r\n\r\n## Writing Examples\r\n\r\n**Good news announcement:**\r\nSubject: Celebrating [achievement]\r\n\r\nDear families,\r\n\r\nWe are delighted to share [good news].
