# Example Conversation: Pupil Premium Planning

## Scenario
A primary school deputy head is planning next year's pupil premium spending and wants evidence-based advice.

## Conversation

**User**: Hi Ed, I need help planning our pupil premium spending for next year. We have 92 PP pupils and will receive about £120k. What's the best way to spend it?

**Ed** (activates `pupil_premium_planner` skill):

Thanks for reaching out! £120k for 92 PP pupils is a significant budget - roughly £1,300 per pupil. The key is spending it in evidence-based ways that will actually close the disadvantage gap.

Before I suggest specific interventions, I need to understand your context:

1. **What are your identified barriers to learning** for PP pupils? (e.g., low starting points, language gaps, attendance issues, limited home support for reading)
2. **What's your current attainment gap** between PP and non-PP pupils?
3. **What phase are you?** (I'm guessing primary based on your PP cohort size)
4. **What are you currently spending PP on?** (so I know what's already working)

Once I understand your context, I can suggest evidence-based interventions matched to your specific barriers.

---

**User**: We're a 2-form entry primary (YR-Y6). Our main barriers are:
- Low starting points (many PP pupils start YR well below ARE in language/literacy)
- Limited home support for reading
- Some attendance issues (though not majority)
- Vocabulary gaps affecting comprehension across curriculum

Current attainment gap at KS2 is about 18% (PP: 62% expected standard in RWM, non-PP: 80%).

We've been spending on: a TA to support PP pupils in each class, after-school homework club, breakfast club, and educational trips.

**Ed** (analyzing current spending against EEF evidence):

Thanks for that context - it's really helpful. I can see why you've chosen those interventions, but I need to be honest: **your current spending plan is unlikely to close that 18% gap**. Let me explain why, and suggest a more effective approach.

## Analysis of Current Spending

### ❌ TA in each class to support PP pupils
**EEF Evidence**: TA interventions +4 months, ⭐⭐⭐ (but warning: ineffective if used to separate PP pupils from teacher)

**The problem**:
- If TAs are 'velcroed' to PP pupils all day, research shows this can be **harmful**
- Separates PP pupils from the teacher (the most qualified person)
- Creates learned helplessness ("I'll wait for the TA to help")
- Lower expectations in TA-led groups

**Estimated cost**: £100k+ (5 TAs full-time)
**Verdict**: **High cost, low/negative impact as currently deployed**

### ⚠️ After-school homework club
**EEF Evidence**: +2 months (primary), ⭐⭐

**The problem**:
- Useful for providing space/resources but won't close gap
- Homework has limited impact in primary
- Better as supplement to stronger interventions, not main strategy

**Estimated cost**: £5k
**Verdict**: **Keep but don't rely on it as main intervention**

### ✅ Breakfast club
**EEF Evidence**: +2 months, ⭐⭐

**The verdict**:
- Good for removing barriers (hunger, late arrival)
- Won't close attainment gap directly but helps pupils be ready to learn
- Cost-effective

**Estimated cost**: £8k
**Verdict**: **Keep this**

### ❌ Educational trips
**EEF Evidence**: Aspiration interventions +0 months, ⭐⭐⭐

**The problem**:
- PP pupils often already have high aspirations
- The barrier is achieving aspirations (need exam results, not motivation)
- Valuable for cultural capital but shouldn't be PP priority

**Estimated cost**: £7k
**Verdict**: **Fund from enrichment budget, not PP**

## Current Budget Allocation

Your plan roughly splits as:
- **Tier 1 (Teaching)**: £0 (0%) ❌
- **Tier 2 (Targeted support)**: £105k (87%) - mostly TAs ⚠️
- **Tier 3 (Wider strategies)**: £15k (13%) - breakfast, trips ✅/❌

**EEF Recommendation**: 70-80% teaching, 15-20% targeted support, 5-10% wider strategies

**Your biggest issue**: Nothing invested in improving quality first teaching, which benefits all pupils and has largest effect sizes.

## Expected Impact

With this revised approach:

1. **All pupils benefit** from improved teaching quality (reading comp, vocabulary, feedback, metacognition)
2. **PP pupils get additional support** through targeted interventions (matched to their specific gaps)
3. **Wider barriers addressed** (attendance, breakfast, enrichment)
4. **Budget allocation matches evidence** (70% teaching, 20% targeted, 10% wider)
5. **Interventions matched to your barriers** (language/vocab gaps, low starting points, limited home reading support)

**Realistic impact**: Close your 18% gap to around 10-12% in Year 1, with sustained focus getting it below 5% by Year 3.

## Success Criteria for Your PP Strategy Statement

For each intervention, suggest measuring:

1. **Reading comprehension**: % PP pupils at expected standard in reading (target: 62% → 75%)
2. **Vocabulary**: Bedrock scores (target: 12+ months progress in 6 months)
3. **Phonics**: Y1 phonics pass rate for PP pupils (target: 85%+)
4. **Attainment gap**: PP vs non-PP gap at KS2 (target: 18% → 12% Year 1)
5. **Attendance**: PP attendance (target: 96%+)
6. **Quality first teaching**: % lessons with effective feedback/metacognition (target: 90%+)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Share this plan with SLT** - do they agree with the shift in spending?
2. **Cost each intervention precisely** - get quotes for CPD, resources
3. **Draft pupil premium strategy statement** - I can help with this
4. **Consult with staff** - especially on redeploying TAs (sensitive change)
5. **Present to governors for approval** - highlight evidence base
6. **Plan evaluation** - baseline assessments, monitoring schedule
7. **Publish strategy on website** - legal requirement

Would you like me to:
- Help draft your pupil premium strategy statement?
- Suggest specific CPD providers for reading comprehension or metacognition?
- Create a timeline for implementing these changes?
- Explain how to redeploy your TAs without redundancies?

**User**: This is brilliant, thank you! I hadn't realized our TA deployment was so ineffective. Can you help me understand how to redeploy them without redundancies? And yes, I'd love help drafting the strategy statement.

**Ed**:

Absolutely - the TA redeployment is the trickiest part because it's a big change, but you can do it without redundancies. Here's how...

[Conversation would continue with Ed providing practical guidance on TA redeployment and then helping draft the strategy statement]
