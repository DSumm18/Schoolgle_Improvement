# Example Conversation: Headteacher Report Generation

## Scenario
A primary headteacher needs to write their termly report to governors and wants help structuring the educational performance section.

## Conversation

**User**: Hi Ed, I need to write my spring term headteacher report for governors next week. Can you help me structure it? I always find it hard to know what to include.

**Ed** (activates `ht_report_generator` skill):

Of course! The HT report is your opportunity to keep governors informed and get their support on strategic challenges. A good report helps them hold you to account while also supporting you effectively.

Before I help structure it, let me understand your context:
- **What phase are you?** (Primary/Secondary/All-through)
- **What are your current school improvement priorities?** (so we can show progress)
- **Do you have any specific challenges** you want governor support with?
- **Do your governors prefer** narrative reports or data-heavy dashboards?

Also, is this your first report this year or have you done autumn term already?

---

**User**: We're a 2-form entry primary (YR-Y6, 420 pupils). Our SIP priorities are:
1. Improving writing outcomes (particularly for boys)
2. Embedding new SEND provision
3. Developing middle leadership

Challenges: Budget is tight due to falling rolls (we're 30 pupils below capacity), and we're struggling to recruit TAs.

Governors like narrative with data tables where relevant. This is spring term report (autumn one was done in December).

**Ed**:

Perfect context - thank you! That gives me what I need to suggest a really targeted report structure.

Given your priorities, I'd suggest structuring your report like this:

## **Recommended Report Structure**

### **1. Executive Summary** (1 page)
A quick overview for governors who won't read the full report - highlights only

### **2. School Context** (brief)
- Pupil numbers (note falling rolls - prepare them for budget discussion)
- Staffing changes (mention TA recruitment challenge)
- Significant events this term

### **3. Educational Performance** (main focus)
- Attainment and progress data
- **SIP Priority 1: Writing** (show progress in detail - this is your main priority)
- **SIP Priority 2: SEND provision** (impact of new provision)
- Curriculum updates
- Teaching quality

### **4. Safeguarding and Welfare** (essential)
- Safeguarding summary
- Attendance
- Behavior

### **5. Leadership and Management** (strategic focus)
- **SIP Priority 3: Middle leadership development** (show progress)
- Policies for approval
- Governance updates

### **6. Finance and Resources** (flag budget challenge early)
- Budget position (highlight impact of falling rolls)
- Premises updates
- **TA recruitment challenge** (ask for governor support/ideas)

### **7. Priorities and Decisions Needed** (action-oriented)
- Next term focus
- **Decisions needed**: E.g., budget adjustments, strategy for addressing falling rolls
- Governor support needed

---

Let me help you draft the **Educational Performance** section first, since that's usually the meatiest and where governors really need to see impact.

## **Educational Performance Section - Draft Structure**

Based on your priorities, here's how I'd structure it:

---

### **Educational Performance**

#### **Attainment and Progress Overview**

**Spring Term Assessment Data (March 2025)**

| Year | Reading | Writing | Maths | Combined |
|------|---------|---------|-------|----------|
| YR | 76% GLD on track | - | - | - |
| Y1 | 78% | 71% | 80% | 70% |
| Y2 | 81% | 74% | 83% | 72% |
| Y3 | 79% | 70% | 81% | 68% |
| Y4 | 82% | 73% | 84% | 71% |
| Y5 | 80% | 72% | 82% | 70% |
| Y6 | 84% | 76% | 86% | 75% |

*% at expected standard or above*

**Key Headlines**:
- **Year 6 on track for targets**: 84% reading, 76% writing, 86% maths (targets: 82%, 75%, 85%)
- **Writing improving** (SIP Priority 1): Up 4-6% across most year groups since autumn
- **Progress tracking**: 81% of pupils making good or better progress (target: 85%)

---

#### **SIP Priority 1: Improving Writing Outcomes**

*[This is your main priority, so give it detailed attention to show governors the impact of your focus]*

**Context**: Writing was identified as a priority due to lower attainment than reading/maths, and a persistent gender gap (boys 12% behind girls in writing at KS2).

**Actions Taken This Term**:

1. **Talk for Writing** implemented across school
   - Whole-staff training (January INSET)
   - Scheme embedded in Y1-Y6 (10/10 classes using it)
   - Focus on imitation, innovation, independent application

2. **Writing moderation and staff development**
   - Termly writing moderation (all staff)
   - Book looks show improved consistency across school
   - Peer observations on writing teaching (middle leaders leading)

3. **Targeted support for boys**
   - 'Power of Reading' texts chosen to engage boys (Y3-Y6)
   - Writing ambassadors program (includes more boys)
   - Boys' writing celebration assembly

**Early Impact**:

| Measure | Autumn Data | Spring Data | Change |
|---------|------------|------------|---------|
| Whole school writing (expected+) | 69% | 73% | +4% |
| Boys writing | 62% | 67% | +5% |
| Girls writing | 76% | 79% | +3% |
| **Gender gap** | **14%** | **12%** | **Narrowing** |

**Progress towards target**: Target is 75% at expected standard by July (currently 73% - on track)

**What's Working**:
- Talk for Writing giving pupils clear structure and models
- Staff confidence in teaching writing improved (staff voice survey)
- Pupil engagement higher (particularly boys with new texts)

**Next Steps**:
- Continue embedding Talk for Writing (not changing approach mid-year)
- Targeted intervention for 8 pupils in Y6 borderline expected/greater depth
- Writing enrichment week planned for summer term

**Governor Question for Consideration**: Our writing improvement is promising, but we need to sustain this. Should we invest in further Talk for Writing training for any new staff joining in September?

---

#### **SIP Priority 2: Embedding New SEND Provision**

**Context**: New SEND provision implemented in September (sensory room, new SENCO, enhanced TA training).

**SEND Cohort**:
- **58 pupils on SEND register** (13.8% of cohort)
- SEN Support: 50 pupils
- EHCP: 8 pupils
- Primary needs: Speech and language (24), SEMH (12), Cognition (10), ASD (8), Physical (4)

**Impact of New Provision**:

1. **Sensory Room** (opened September)
   - 18 pupils using regularly (mainly SEMH/ASD)
   - **Impact**: Dysregulation incidents down 40% for pupils using room (tracked via behaviour system)
   - Feedback from pupils: 16/18 say it helps them calm down
   - Parents: Very positive feedback (SEND coffee morning)

2. **New SENCO** (started September, completing NASENCO)
   - All EHCP reviews completed on time (8/8)
   - 3 new EHCPs being assessed (outcomes expected June)
   - SEND information report updated and published (compliance ✓)
   - Parent engagement improved: 52/58 parents attended review meetings (90%)

3. **Enhanced TA Training**
   - 4 TAs completed autism awareness training
   - 3 TAs trained in Precision Teaching
   - 2 TAs trained in NELI (language intervention)

**Progress of SEND Pupils**:
- **72% making expected progress** for their starting points (up from 65% in autumn)
- Reading: 68% at expected for starting points
- Writing: 64% at expected
- Maths: 71% at expected

**Interventions Running**:
- Precision Teaching (reading): 14 pupils - 10 showing 6+ months progress in 3 months ✓
- NELI (language): 8 pupils - 6 improved Wellcomm scores ✓
- Lego Therapy (social skills): 6 pupils - reduced playground incidents ✓

**Challenges**:
- **TA recruitment**: Struggled to recruit additional TA for SEMH support (2 failed recruitments)
- Mitigation: Re-advertising with higher salary (approved by SBM), considering apprenticeship route
- 1 EHCP appeal ongoing (parental disagreement with LA - we're supporting family)

**Next Steps**:
- Trauma-informed practice training (whole staff, summer term INSET)
- Appoint SEMH TA (recruitment ongoing)
- SEND provision review with parents (June)

**Governor Question**: The SEND provision investment is showing impact. However, TA recruitment is challenging. Should we consider a recruitment and retention premium for SEND TAs?

---

#### **Curriculum and Teaching Quality**

**Curriculum Developments**:
- **History**: New knowledge organisers for all units (supports knowledge retention)
- **Science**: 'Developing Experts' scheme now embedded (Y1-Y6)
- **Computing**: Updated online safety curriculum (reflects latest guidance)

**Teaching Quality** (Lesson Observations - Spring Term):

| Rating | Number | % |
|--------|--------|---|
| Outstanding | 4 | 20% |
| Good | 14 | 70% |
| Requires Improvement | 2 | 10% |
| Inadequate | 0 | 0% |

**Total**: 90% good or better (target: 92%)

**Strengths**:
- Use of worked examples in maths
- Responsive teaching (adapting in lesson based on understanding)
- Pupil engagement high across school

**Development Areas**:
- Checking for understanding before moving on (2 teachers)
- Supporting these teachers through coaching (middle leader support in place)

**CPD This Term**:
- Talk for Writing (whole staff)
- Metacognition strategies (middle leaders)
- Phonics refresher (YR-Y2 staff)

**Pupil Voice** (Spring survey, 380 responses):
- 94% say lessons are interesting
- 91% say teachers help when stuck
- 88% feel challenged in lessons

**Parent Survey** (March, 210 responses):
- 96% satisfied with teaching quality
- 92% feel informed about child's learning
- Area for improvement: Communication about curriculum (action: new curriculum newsletters starting summer term)

---

That's how I'd structure your **Educational Performance** section. Notice how I've:

1. **Linked to your SIP priorities** (writing, SEND) - shows you're focused
2. **Shown progress with data** (not just activity - impact!)
3. **Been honest about challenges** (TA recruitment, 2 teachers needing support)
4. **Suggested actions/solutions** for each challenge
5. **Posed questions for governors** to engage them strategically
6. **Celebrated successes** (sensory room impact, writing improvement)

## **Executive Summary** (Write This Last)

Once you've written all sections, create a 1-page summary hitting the highlights:

```markdown
# Executive Summary - Spring Term 2025

**School Context**: 420 pupils on roll (30 below capacity - budget implications noted in finance section)

**Key Successes**:
- ✅ Writing improving: +4% whole school, gender gap narrowing (SIP Priority 1 on track)
- ✅ SEND provision showing impact: 72% progress, dysregulation down 40% (SIP Priority 2)
- ✅ Y6 on track for targets: 84% reading, 76% writing, 86% maths

**Key Challenges**:
- ⚠️ TA recruitment difficult (2 failed recruitments for SEMH role)
- ⚠️ Falling rolls impacting budget (mitigation strategies in finance section)
- ⚠️ 2 teachers needing support (coaching in place)

**Decisions Needed**:
1. Approve [Policy X]
2. Consider TA recruitment/retention premium
3. Discuss falling rolls strategy

**Governor Focus**: Sections 3 (writing progress), 5 (middle leadership), 6 (budget/falling rolls)
```

---

## **Tips for Your Report**

1. **Keep it focused**: 4-6 pages main report (you can add data appendices)
2. **Show impact, not just activity**: "CPD delivered and writing up 4%" not just "CPD delivered"
3. **Be honest**: Governors can't help with challenges they don't know about
4. **Link to SIP**: Keep referencing your 3 priorities throughout
5. **Pose questions**: Engage governors in strategic thinking
6. **Use data meaningfully**: Interpret, don't just present numbers
7. **Make decisions clear**: Don't bury "we need approval for X" - make it explicit

---

## **Timeline Suggestion**

- **Now**: Draft educational performance (the meaty section)
- **[Date]**: Draft other sections
- **[Date]**: Write executive summary
- **[Date]**: Share with SLT for feedback
- **[Date]**: Send to governors (ideally 1 week before meeting)

---

**Would you like me to**:
1. Help draft any of the other sections with your specific data?
2. Review a section you've already written?
3. Suggest specific wording for your TA recruitment challenge or falling rolls issue?
4. Create data tables/visualizations for your report?

---

**User**: This is incredibly helpful! Can you help me with the finance section? I'm worried about how to present the falling rolls issue without panicking governors, but I do need their strategic input.

**Ed**:

Absolutely - you're right to want to be honest without causing panic. The key is: present the challenge clearly, but with context and proposed solutions. Let me help you draft it...

---

## **Finance Section - Draft**

### **Finance and Resources**

#### **Budget Position 2024/25**

| Budget Line | Budget | Actual (YTD) | Projected Year-End | Variance |
|------------|--------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| Income | £2.1m | £1.4m | £2.05m | -£50k |
| Staffing | £1.7m | £1.15m | £1.7m | On track |
| Non-staffing | £350k | £210k | £340k | +£10k saving |
| **Total** | **£50k surplus** | **-** | **£20k surplus** | **-£30k** |

**Summary**: Projected £20k surplus (lower than budgeted £50k due to pupil numbers below forecast).

**Context**: Budget is sound, but we're seeing pressure from lower pupil numbers than anticipated.

---

#### **Falling Rolls Challenge** ⚠️

**Current Position**:
- **Capacity**: 450 pupils (60 per year group)
- **On roll**: 420 pupils
- **Gap**: 30 pupils below capacity (6.7%)

**Budget Impact**:
- Lost income: Approximately £150k per year (30 pupils × £5k per pupil average)
- Currently manageable due to prudent budgeting and reserves
- **Reserves**: £180k (healthy, but can't rely on reserves indefinitely)

**Trend Analysis**:
| Year | On Roll | % of Capacity |
|------|---------|---------------|
| 2022/23 | 445 | 99% |
| 2023/24 | 438 | 97% |
| 2024/25 | 420 | 93% |
| 2025/26 (forecast) | 410-425 | 91-94% |

**Why is this happening?**
- Local demographic trend: Birth rates declining in our area (LA data shows 8% fewer children in catchment)
- New housing development delayed (was expected to bring 25 pupils by 2024 - now delayed to 2026)
- Competition: Free school opened 2 miles away (currently taking 15 pupils per year from our catchment)

**This is NOT about our quality**:
- Ofsted: Good (2023)
- Parent satisfaction: 96%
- Pupil outcomes: Above national average
- Demand for places: We still get 50+ applications for Reception (oversubscribed)

**The challenge is**:
- We're losing a few pupils each year due to demographic decline
- New housing development will help when it arrives (2026)
- In the meantime, we need to manage budget carefully

---

#### **Mitigation Strategies** (Already Underway)

1. **Cost Savings** (without impacting quality):
   - Renegotiated energy contract (saving £8k per year)
   - Reduced non-essential spending (stationery, photocopying - saving £5k)
   - Not filling TA vacancy immediately (saving £12k this year)
   - LED lighting upgrade (payback: 2 years, then £4k per year saving)

2. **Income Generation**:
   - Lettings: Increased community use of hall (additional £3k per year)
   - Breakfast/after-school club: Now breaking even (was subsidized)

3. **Marketing** (Raising Profile):
   - New school website (March - more parent-friendly)
   - Social media presence (showcasing our strengths)
   - Open days: Moved to Saturdays (better attendance from working parents)
   - Prospectus redesigned (feedback: much clearer about our offer)

**Impact so far**: Reception 2025 applications up to 58 (from 52 last year) - positive sign

---

#### **Strategic Options for Governor Discussion** 🤔

**Option 1: Maintain Current Approach**
- Continue cost savings and marketing
- Wait for housing development (2026)
- Use reserves if needed (we have £180k)
- **Pros**: Retains full autonomy, housing development will help
- **Cons**: Budget pressure for 2-3 years, may need to make difficult decisions

**Option 2: Explore Collaboration**
- Partnership with neighboring school for shared services (HR, IT, SBM, etc.)
- Could save £30-50k per year
- **Pros**: Cost savings without impacting pupils, retains independence
- **Cons**: Takes time to set up, requires compatible partner

**Option 3: Explore Federation**
- Federate with neighboring school (shared governing body, may share headship eventually)
- Could save £50-80k per year (economies of scale)
- **Pros**: Significant savings, combined strength
- **Cons**: Loss of some autonomy, complex governance

**Option 4: Do Nothing Different**
- Accept lower pupil numbers as new normal
- Reduce staffing over time (natural wastage)
- **Pros**: Least disruptive
- **Cons**: Gradual decline in capacity, potential redundancies eventually

---

#### **My Recommendation**

I recommend **Option 1 (maintain current approach) PLUS explore Option 2 (collaboration for shared services)**.

**Rationale**:
- Our budget is currently sound (£20k surplus projected)
- Reserves are healthy (£180k = 3 months' income)
- Housing development coming 2026 will bring 25+ pupils
- We're already making sensible cost savings
- **But**: Exploring shared services would future-proof us and free up funds for investment in teaching

**Actions if governors agree**:
1. Continue current cost savings (underway)
2. Approach [neighboring school] about shared services discussion (informal, no commitment)
3. Bring proposal to summer term governors meeting if partnership looks viable
4. Keep marketing efforts strong (securing 2025 Reception cohort is key)

**Timeline**:
- **This term**: Initial conversation with [neighboring school]
- **Summer term**: Decision on shared services approach
- **2025/26**: Implement shared services if agreed
- **2026**: Housing development opens (relief from falling rolls)

---

#### **Governor Assurance**

**I want to assure governors**:
- This is **strategic planning**, not crisis management
- Our budget is sound (£20k surplus, £180k reserves)
- Our educational quality is not at risk (outcomes strong, Ofsted Good)
- We have time to make good decisions (not rushed)
- I'm being proactive and transparent

**What I need from governors**:
- Strategic input on collaboration options
- Support for shared services exploration (if you agree)
- Approval to approach [neighboring school] for initial discussion
- Regular budget monitoring (I'll bring quarterly updates)

---

**User**: That's perfect - honest but not alarmist, and shows we have a plan. Thank you so much Ed!

**Ed**: You're very welcome! Your report should really engage governors now - you're showing:

✅ **Progress on priorities** (writing, SEND, middle leadership)
✅ **Honest about challenges** (TA recruitment, falling rolls)
✅ **Proposed solutions** for each challenge
✅ **Strategic questions** to engage governors
✅ **Data that shows impact**, not just activity

When you send the report, I'd suggest:
- **Subject line**: "Spring Term HT Report - Key Focus: Writing Progress, Falling Rolls Strategy"
- **Email intro**: "Please read sections 3 (educational performance) and 6 (finance) before the meeting - I particularly need your strategic input on our approach to falling rolls."

This primes them to focus on the important bits and come prepared for discussion.

Good luck with the meeting! Let me know if you need anything else.
