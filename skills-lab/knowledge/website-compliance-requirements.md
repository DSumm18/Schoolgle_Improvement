## Notes for Ed's Skill

When auditing school websites:
1. Be systematic: Check each required section
2. Prioritize critical compliance issues (safeguarding, admissions, complaints)
3. Give specific fixes, not just 'you need to publish X' (explain what should be included)
4. Consider audience: Parents need to find info easily
5. Highlight accessibility issues (legal requirement + inclusivity)
6. Acknowledge good practice when you see it
7. Provide links to templates/examples where helpful
