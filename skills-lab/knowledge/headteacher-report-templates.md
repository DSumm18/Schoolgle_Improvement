# Headteacher Report to Governors - Templates and Guidance

## Purpose of HT Report

The headteacher's report to governors is a critical document that:
- Updates governors on school performance and operational matters
- Highlights areas requiring governor scrutiny or decisions
- Demonstrates accountability
- Records key information for governance minutes
- Prepares governors for strategic discussions

**Frequency**: Usually termly (3 times per year), though some schools do 6 per year

## Legal Context

While not legally prescribed in a specific format, the HT report relates to:
- **Governance Handbook**: Governors must hold leaders to account for educational performance
- **Ofsted Framework**: Evidence of effective governance includes governors challenging and supporting leaders
- **Academy Trust Handbook**: Trustees must ensure educational and financial performance

## Report Formats

### Option 1: Narrative Report
- Most common
- Written in paragraphs under clear headings
- Easier to explain context and nuance
- Can be lengthy (typically 4-8 pages)

### Option 2: Dashboard/Data Report
- Visual (charts, tables, RAG ratings)
- Quicker to read
- Good for data-heavy sections
- May need supplementary narrative for context

### Option 3: Hybrid
- Executive summary (1 page dashboard)
- Detailed report for key areas
- Appendices for detailed data
- **Best practice**: Combines brevity with depth

## Best Practices

### 1. Focus on Impact, Not Just Activity
**Weak**: "We ran a writing CPD session"
**Strong**: "Writing CPD delivered to all staff. Early impact: % of pupils achieving expected standard up from 68% to 74%"

### 2. Highlight Areas Needing Governor Attention
**Weak**: "Attendance is 94.2%"
**Strong**: "Attendance is 94.2% (below target of 96%). Governors should note: we've implemented new attendance policy and attendance officer is monitoring 12 PA pupils. Impact expected by summer term."

### 3. Use Data Meaningfully
**Weak**: "Reading scores have improved"
**Strong**: "Reading: 82% at expected standard (up from 76% last term, target 85%). Gap between PP and non-PP narrowed from 15% to 9%."

### 4. Be Honest About Challenges
**Weak**: "Everything is going well"
**Strong**: "Staffing is a challenge. We've struggled to recruit for Year 4 teacher position (2 failed recruitments). Mitigations: internal cover, partnership with local school for shared teacher, recruiting again in May."

### 5. Suggest Actions, Not Just Problems
**Weak**: "Budget is tight"
**Strong**: "Budget pressures due to energy costs. Proposed actions: LED lighting upgrade (payback 2 years), renegotiate contracts, reduce non-staffing spend by 5%."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too long**: Governors won't read 15-page reports
✅ **Aim for**: 4-6 pages (with appendices for detailed data)

❌ **Just data**: Raw numbers without interpretation
✅ **Explain**: What data means, trends, actions

❌ **Avoiding bad news**: Governors can't help if they don't know
✅ **Be honest**: Explain challenges and proposed solutions

❌ **No priorities**: Everything seems equally important
✅ **Highlight**: What needs governor focus this meeting

❌ **Jargon-heavy**: Acronyms and edu-speak
✅ **Clear language**: Explain terms, write for a non-educator

## Governance Expectations

Effective governors will:
- **Read the report** before the meeting (if they don't, consider shorter executive summary)
- **Ask questions**: "What's working? What isn't? How do you know? What are you doing about it?"
- **Challenge**: Not accepting "fine" - want evidence
- **Support**: Offer help with strategic challenges

The HT report should enable governors to:
- **Monitor** progress against school improvement plan
- **Hold to account** for pupil outcomes
- **Make decisions** on policies, budget, staffing
- **Provide support** for strategic challenges
- **Ensure compliance** with legal requirements

## Notes for Ed's Skill

When helping generate HT reports:
1. Start with school context to understand what data/priorities are relevant
2. Encourage focus on impact, not just activity
3. Suggest appropriate level of detail (summary + appendices if needed)
4. Highlight where governor scrutiny is needed
5. Ensure compliance sections included (safeguarding, attendance, budget, SEND)
6. Make it readable (avoid jargon, explain acronyms)
7. Include previous priorities to show progress
8. Suggest data visualizations where helpful
