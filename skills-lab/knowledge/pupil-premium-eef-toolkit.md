# EEF Teaching & Learning Toolkit - Pupil Premium Planning

## Overview
The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) Teaching & Learning Toolkit provides evidence ratings for different educational interventions. This knowledge base helps schools make evidence-informed decisions about pupil premium spending.

## EEF Evidence Ratings System

**Impact**: Measured in months of additional progress
**Cost**: £ to £££££ (very low to very high)
**Evidence Strength**: ⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (limited to very extensive)

## High Impact Interventions (Tier 1 - Quality First Teaching)

### 1. Feedback (+6 months impact, Very low cost, ⭐⭐⭐⭐)
**What it is**: Providing information to pupils about their learning, including next steps
**Why it works**:
- Specific, actionable feedback helps pupils understand how to improve
- Most effective when timely and focused on the task, not the person
- Works across all subjects and age groups

**Implementation considerations**:
- Verbal feedback often as effective as written
- Pupils need time to act on feedback
- Marking policies should prioritize meaningful feedback over ticks
- Focus on 'closing the gap' activities

**Typical costs**: Primarily staff time (CPD, marking policies)

**Evidence-based approaches**:
- Think-pair-share for peer feedback
- Live marking during lessons
- Whole-class feedback sheets
- Pupils responding to feedback in green pen

### 2. Metacognition and Self-Regulation (+7 months, Very low cost, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
**What it is**: Teaching pupils to plan, monitor, and evaluate their learning
**Why it works**:
- Pupils become independent learners
- Particularly beneficial for disadvantaged pupils
- Transfers across subjects

**Implementation considerations**:
- Explicitly teach metacognitive strategies
- Model thinking processes aloud
- Use planning frameworks (e.g., 'What do I know? What do I need to find out?')
- Provide scaffolding, gradually remove it

**Typical costs**: Staff CPD and resources

**Evidence-based approaches**:
- Learning logs/journals
- Success criteria co-created with pupils
- Self and peer assessment
- 'Think aloud' modeling

### 3. Mastery Learning (+5 months, Very low cost, ⭐⭐⭐)
**What it is**: Breaking learning into units with clear objectives, ensuring understanding before moving on
**Why it works**:
- Prevents knowledge gaps from accumulating
- Formative assessment identifies misconceptions early
- All pupils can achieve high standards given time

**Implementation considerations**:
- Requires flexible curriculum pacing
- Need pre-tests to identify starting points
- Formative assessment throughout
- Extension activities for pupils who grasp concepts quickly

**Typical costs**: Planning time and assessment resources

**Evidence-based approaches**:
- White Rose Maths scheme (mastery approach)
- Regular 'check for understanding' questioning
- Same-day intervention for pupils who haven't grasped concepts

## Medium Impact Interventions (Tier 2 - Targeted Academic Support)

### 4. One-to-One Tuition (+5 months, Moderate cost, ⭐⭐⭐)
**What it is**: Intensive teaching sessions with individual pupils
**Why it works**:
- Tailored to individual needs
- High level of interaction and feedback
- Can target specific gaps

**Implementation considerations**:
- Most effective when delivered by qualified teachers
- Short, regular sessions (3-5 per week) better than occasional long sessions
- Should complement classroom teaching, not replace it
- Needs careful alignment with class curriculum

**Typical costs**: £20-40 per hour for tutors

**Evidence-based approaches**:
- National Tutoring Programme (NTP) partnerships
- Internal staff delivering tuition (release time required)
- Online tutoring platforms (e.g., Third Space Learning for maths)

### 5. Small Group Tuition (+4 months, Moderate cost, ⭐⭐⭐)
**What it is**: Teaching in groups of 2-5 pupils
**Why it works**:
- More cost-effective than 1-1
- Pupils benefit from peer discussion
- Intensive support still possible

**Implementation considerations**:
- Groups of 2-3 most effective
- Target specific skills or knowledge gaps
- Typically 3-5 sessions per week
- Can be delivered by trained TAs if well-structured

**Typical costs**: TA time or external tutors

**Evidence-based approaches**:
- Pre-teaching vocabulary before main lesson
- Booster groups for specific topics
- Phonics intervention groups (e.g., Fresh Start)

### 6. Reading Comprehension Strategies (+6 months, Very low cost, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
**What it is**: Explicitly teaching strategies to understand texts
**Why it works**:
- Reading underpins all subjects
- Disadvantaged pupils often have weaker comprehension skills
- Strategies can be applied across curriculum

**Implementation considerations**:
- Teach strategies explicitly (prediction, clarifying, questioning, summarizing)
- Model strategies with think-aloud
- Provide scaffolding (graphic organizers, sentence stems)
- Practice across different text types

**Typical costs**: Staff CPD and resources

**Evidence-based approaches**:
- Reciprocal reading
- KWL grids (Know, Want to know, Learned)
- Reading Reconsidered techniques
- Inference training

## Lower Impact Interventions (Use with caution)

### 7. Teaching Assistant Interventions (+4 months, Moderate cost, ⭐⭐⭐)
**What it is**: TAs delivering structured interventions or supporting in class
**Why it works (when done well)**:
- Can deliver evidence-based interventions (e.g., phonics programs)
- Allows targeted small group work

**Implementation considerations**:
- **Warning**: TAs often deployed ineffectively (e.g., supporting lower-attaining pupils all day, separating them from teacher)
- Most effective when delivering structured programs with training
- Teachers should maintain responsibility for PP pupils' progress
- TAs should supplement, not replace, teacher instruction

**Typical costs**: TA salaries (£18-22k pro rata)

**Evidence-based approaches**:
- TAs deliver specific interventions (e.g., Precision Teaching, Rapid Phonics)
- TAs prepare resources/scaffold tasks, teacher leads learning
- TAs work with middle/higher attainers while teacher works with disadvantaged pupils

### 8. Homework (Secondary +5 months, Primary +2 months, Very low cost, ⭐⭐)
**What it is**: Tasks set to be completed outside lesson time
**Why impact varies**:
- Can reinforce learning if well-designed
- Disadvantaged pupils may lack support/space at home
- Can widen gap if not carefully managed

**Implementation considerations**:
- Provide quiet spaces for homework at school
- Ensure tasks are accessible without parental help
- Check for understanding before setting homework
- Keep homework focused (quality over quantity)

**Typical costs**: Homework club supervision

**Evidence-based approaches**:
- Breakfast/after-school homework clubs
- Online platforms (e.g., Hegarty Maths, Bedrock Vocabulary)
- Provide resources (e.g., reading books, knowledge organisers)

## Low/Negative Impact Interventions (Avoid)

### 9. Setting/Streaming (0 months, Evidence of harm to lower sets)
**What it is**: Grouping pupils by prior attainment
**Why to avoid**:
- Lower sets make less progress
- Disadvantaged pupils disproportionately in lower sets
- Pupils internalize negative labels
- Lower expectations in bottom sets

**Alternative approaches**:
- Mixed attainment teaching with careful differentiation
- Within-class grouping (flexible, task-specific)
- High expectations for all

### 10. Aspiration Interventions (+0 months, Low cost, ⭐⭐⭐)
**What it is**: Trips, visiting speakers, rewards to raise aspirations
**Why limited impact**:
- Disadvantaged pupils often have high aspirations already
- The barrier is accessing routes to achieve aspirations (social capital, exam results)
- Can be valuable for other reasons (cultural capital, wellbeing) but not a substitute for academic support

**Better alternative**: Focus PP spending on proven interventions (feedback, metacognition, tuition)

## Three-Tiered Approach to PP Spending

### Tier 1: Teaching (Highest Priority - 70-80% of budget)
- Teacher CPD on feedback, metacognition, subject knowledge
- High-quality curriculum resources
- Instructional coaching
- Evidence-based teaching approaches

**Why prioritize**: Quality first teaching benefits all pupils, has largest effect size

### Tier 2: Targeted Academic Support (15-20% of budget)
- Small group/1-1 tuition for identified gaps
- Structured interventions (phonics, reading, numeracy)
- Pre-teaching of key concepts

**Why important**: Addresses specific gaps that QFT alone can't close

### Tier 3: Wider Strategies (5-10% of budget)
- Attendance support
- Behavior interventions
- Breakfast clubs
- Wellbeing support
- Enrichment (if Tiers 1&2 well-funded)

**Why last**: Important but only effective if academic support in place

## Pupil Premium Strategy Statement Requirements

Schools must publish:
1. **School context**: Number of PP pupils, barriers to learning
2. **Spending priorities**: Which interventions chosen and why
3. **Success criteria**: How impact will be measured
4. **Budget breakdown**: How much allocated to each intervention
5. **Previous year's impact**: What worked, what didn't

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Scattergun approach**: Too many small interventions, none funded properly
2. **Favorite interventions**: Choosing based on what school likes, not evidence
3. **Low-cost obsession**: Choosing interventions just because they're cheap
4. **Teacher-directed only**: Not involving senior leaders in impact measurement
5. **Ignoring wider barriers**: Not addressing attendance, SEMH if they're blockers
6. **No evaluation**: Not measuring impact rigorously

## Effective PP Spending Checklist

✅ Chosen interventions have strong EEF evidence (+4 months or more)
✅ Majority of budget (70-80%) on quality first teaching
✅ Clear success criteria and evaluation plan
✅ Staff training and implementation support included
✅ Addresses school's specific barriers (use data)
✅ PP pupils get additional support, not different (lower) curriculum
✅ Regular monitoring by governors
✅ Published strategy accessible to parents

When advising on PP spending:
1. Always cite specific EEF evidence ratings
2. Recommend Tier 1 (teaching) as priority
3. Challenge low-impact interventions politely but clearly
4. Suggest measurable success criteria
5. Help schools align spending to their specific barriers
6. Remind about published strategy requirements
